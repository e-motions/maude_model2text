# Maude Model 2 Text transformation

This project is part of the e-Motions framework. It consists in a Xtend Model2Text transformation intended to generate the code that e-Motions Model to Model transformations produce.

Although it could be used for any Maude model, it is optimized for Maude models resulting of the e-Motions transformations, since indentation and pretty printing are optimized to such models.

## Installation
Minimum requirements: Eclipse Modelling with support for XTend and Java 8.
